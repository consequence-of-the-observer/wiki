            <h2>The Brotherhood of Divinity</h2>
            <p>
                In tales of old it was once said
                <br>
                the old world was not born, but built
                <br>
                a cosmic force known as The Divines entered this space-time 
                <br>
                facisnated by the over-abundance of different energies
                <br>
                The Divines used their power to harness the various powers
                <br>
                controlling such raw energy is dangerous, but once channeled
                <br>
                the energy could be used to manufacture dimensions
                <br>
                and thus the Realm Crystal was born
                <br>
                built upon a virtually infinite collection of worlds
                <br>
                but alas...
            </p>

            <p>
                Overtime the divines disapeared, but their tales lived on across the fragmented realities.
                <br>
                Temples built in their name stores the mystical armor they wore.
                <br>
                but beware adventurers, for these temples are filled with disaster.
